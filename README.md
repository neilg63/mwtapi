# MultiWebTest API

This is a versatile advanced survey and test management system that supports a wide range of question types and assessment criteria.

This application only provides backend JSON API powered by MongoDB for use as a Web service with frontend Web or mobile applications. 

I'm building a parallel Frontend in Vue JS [MultiWebTest Frontend](https://github.com/neilg63/mwtfront) and will soon build a separate Admin Area. This approach will make it easier to let other developers build their own custom frontend, while still using the same Web service and admin area.
